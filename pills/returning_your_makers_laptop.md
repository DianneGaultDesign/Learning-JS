# Returning your Makers laptop at the end of the course

This is a kind reminder that the laptops have to be returned by the last Friday of the course.  Ideally before the demo presentations (graduation). Please keep the laptop that you need for the presentation and return the others before.

## Remember to

1. Clean the laptop using the wipes in the stationary cabinet.
2. Reset the laptop to Factory settings. You can either use the Mac OS sticks we have or download Mac OS online as you reset the laptop.
3. Report any damages or hardware problems.
4. Return it to Florence on the first floor
