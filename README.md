# MA_js
Materials from Makers Academy weeks 5 & 7 (Javascript weeks). I've cloned the relevant files into this project, but that might mean some links are broken. Especially the "pill" links. So whenever you see the ðŸ’Š next to a link, you can find the relevant file in the "pills" folder of this repo. 

## A quick intro to how this "learning path" works
Basically, every week has an overarching topic and set of goals. During the week, we pair programmed over the "afternoons" challenges. In the mornings, we did a standup and then skills workshops or practicals. So, my suggestion would be to start by going through the "afternoons" challenges. That's the main bit of learning really. And then mix in the practicals and skills workshops as desired. 

It's a different sort of learning in general I guess. Very learn by doing. Each challenge just tells you what you should aim to achieve and then provides links to relevant guidance. The goal is to try and do it without looking at walkthroughs. Though of course, if you get stuck on smth for more than 20 min, just look at the walkthrough, it's there to help. 

## Week 5 - Intro to JS

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language

### Challenges

* [Afternoons - Thermostat](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/blob/master/thermostat/README.md)
* [Weekend - Bowling](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/blob/master/bowling_challenge.md)

### Practicals

* [Learning a new language by translation](https://hackmd.io/kMNgXiPHQf2Q_P9A-tnS9A)
* [JS Objects & Prototypes](https://hackmd.io/nb1VZarCTGicD6dMOo43Ww)
* [Closures](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q)

### Skills workshops

* [Encapsulation with the constructor & prototype pattern](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/blob/master/skills-workshops-5/encapsulation_with_constructor_and_prototype_pattern)
* [Following the flow and getting visibility](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/blob/master/skills-workshops-5/following_the_flow_and_getting_visibility_in_javascript)
* [Following the Ajax request/response cycle](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/tree/master/skills-workshops-5/following_ajax_request_response_cycle)
* [Callbacks and following the flow of control](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/tree/master/skills-workshops-5/callbacks_following_the_flow_of_control)

### Resources

* [Count app](https://github.com/maryrosecook/count):
A tiny JavaScript/Sinatra app that mimics the architecture of the Thermostat app. A useful guide for developers to use for concepts and idioms.

## Week 7

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Build a front-end app in Javascript
* Work competently in Javascript *
* Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

\* This week is analogous to week 2 in that developers will be wrestling with some underlying language concepts that are not well understood (by Makers).

Most of the work and interventions we have run historically are meant to 'de-magic' Javascript and force developers to confront the pieces they are glossing over in an attempt to get work done.

### Challenges

Note: they get the choice of morning goals / afternoon challenges vs all day project groups.

* [Afternoons - Notes app](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/blob/master/further_javascript/README.md)
* [Weekend - News summary](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/tree/master/news-summary-challenge)

### Practicals

* [JS Objects & Prototypes](https://hackmd.io/nb1VZarCTGicD6dMOo43Ww)
* [Closures](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q)
* [Reading beyond your level](https://hackmd.io/F-pmnp3hRhePddmf3mnKGw)
* [Reasoning about JS using frames](https://hackmd.io/cnH7BqucQ7yzqnLiqmizXw)

### Skills workshops

* [Javascript module pattern](https://github.com/DagmaraSz/MA_js/tree/master/skills-workshop-7/javascript-module-pattern-workshop)
