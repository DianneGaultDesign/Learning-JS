# MA_js
Materials from Makers Academy weeks 5 & 7 (Javascript weeks).

## Week 5 - Intro to JS

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language

### Challenges

* [Afternoons - Thermostat](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/thermostat/README.md)
* [Weekend - Bowling](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/neoeno/projects/32)

### Practicals

* [Learning a new language by translation](https://hackmd.io/kMNgXiPHQf2Q_P9A-tnS9A)
* [JS Objects & Prototypes](https://hackmd.io/nb1VZarCTGicD6dMOo43Ww)
* [Closures](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q)

### Skills workshops

* [Encapsulation with the constructor & prototype pattern](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/encapsulation_with_constructor_and_prototype_pattern)
* [Following the flow and getting visibility](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/following_the_flow_and_getting_visibility_in_javascript)
* [Following the Ajax request/response cycle](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/following_ajax_request_response_cycle)
* [Callbacks and following the flow of control](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/callbacks_following_the_flow_of_control)

### Resources

* [Count app](https://github.com/maryrosecook/count):
A tiny JavaScript/Sinatra app that mimics the architecture of the Thermostat app. A useful guide for developers to use for concepts and idioms.

## Week 7

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Build a front-end app in Javascript
* Work competently in Javascript *
* Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

\* This week is analogous to week 2 in that developers will be wrestling with some underlying language concepts that are not well understood (by Makers).

Most of the work and interventions we have run historically are meant to 'de-magic' Javascript and force developers to confront the pieces they are glossing over in an attempt to get work done.

### Challenges

Note: they get the choice of morning goals / afternoon challenges vs all day project groups.

* [Afternoons - Notes app](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript)
* [Weekend - News summary](https://github.com/makersacademy/news-summary-challenge)

### Practicals

* [JS Objects & Prototypes](https://hackmd.io/nb1VZarCTGicD6dMOo43Ww)
* [Closures](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q)
